<img class= "floating" src = "assets/images/Nebiyou Kebede.JPG"  alt="Nebiyou Kebede">
<p>I was born in the capital city of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa. I moved to the United States in 2012.</p>

    I made the decision to move to the United States in search of a better opportunity for me and for
    my familly. Once i moved to the United States there were many hardships in terms of the language 
    barrier and finding a stable job.
    It was a big challeng for the new comers but through time i made it.</p>

<p> Once I get a stable work satuation , I focus on working hard to save some money and to finish 
    my school what i started when i was back home and my dream 
    going to school in United States of pennselvania to upgrade my self to the current computer technology.</p>
    <p>And now I am financially stable, so i decided to join UPenn Bootcamp coding.</p>
